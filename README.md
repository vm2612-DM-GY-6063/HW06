1. What dataset did you use? If not from our class site, include a link.
I used the 2015 Tree Census dataset.

2. Why did you choose this dataset?
I chose this dataset because it provides an opportunity to visually explore urban environmental data, particularly the distribution and health of trees across NYC. Trees play a vital role in urban ecology, and this dataset helps highlight the importance of maintaining urban greenery while showcasing spatial and health-related patterns.

3. Which fields/features/parameters of the dataset did you use?
I used the following fields from the dataset:

Latitude (latitude): Represents the north-south position of the trees.
Longitude (longitude): Represents the east-west position of the trees.
Health (health): Indicates the condition of the tree, categorized as:
Good
Fair
Poor
These fields were chosen to create a map-based visualization that shows the geographic distribution of trees and their health conditions.

4. How many data points did you use?
I used 1000 data points, sampled from the dataset for performance optimization while maintaining the ability to observe meaningful patterns. This aligns with the project requirement of visualizing at least 1000 data points.

5. What are you visualizing? How do the shapes, colors, or movement relate to the data values?
Visualization:
A map-based representation of NYC where tree locations are plotted based on their latitude and longitude.
Shapes:
Each tree is represented by a small circle to indicate its location.
Colors:
Green: Trees in Good health.
Yellow: Trees in Fair health.
Red: Trees in Poor health.
This color coding directly corresponds to the health field.
Legend:
A color-coded legend helps the viewer interpret the tree health categories.

6. Include drawings and images of reference visualizations
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of reference inspirations:

Maps: I referred to NYC maps to approximate borough boundaries 
Color-Coded Data Points: Inspired by environmental visualizations, such as air quality or heatmaps, where colors correspond to levels of severity or condition.
Simple Legends: Used to make the visualization more accessible and self-explanatory.
